# Generalized Reinforcement Learning (GRL)

### Introduction
Learning a control policy that involves time-varying and evolving system dynamics often poses a great challenge to standard reinforcement learning (RL). This repository will focus on building a GRL framework, an adaptive, concept-driven RL system, and crearting instances of GRL agent under such framework. From the high level perspective, a GRL agent continously and periodically fulfills three interleaving processes -- policy learning, reinforcing the reinforcement field via "particle reinforcement" (what? see the paper), and decision concept learning ...

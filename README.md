# Generalized Reinforcement Learning (GRL)

### Introduction
Control policy learning that involves time-varying and evolving system dynamics often poses a great challenge to standard reinforcement learning (RL). This repository will focus on building a GRL framework that periodically fulfill three interleaving processes: policy learning, self-organization on the working memory (aka particle reinforcement), and decision concept learning to realize an adaptive, concept-driven RL system.
